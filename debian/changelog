  [ George Goldberg ]
  * Skeleton implementation of a IM Contact list for Telepathy using Nepomuk.
  * Change the model/view to use QTreeView because QListView/Model is crap. Also get sorting of the contact list as a bonus.
  * Show the presence of contacts in the contact list. WARNING: Currently doesn't update after the app is loaded.
  * Don't use deprecated methods.
  * Don't ship a copy of telepathy.trig anymore, but use the one installed by t-i-d.
  * Hackish implementation for listening to changes on Nepomuk Resources.
  * Use QHash instead of QMap, since docs say it is quicker for looking up items by key.
  * When a contact item's resources in Nepomuk change, tell the view that model data changed.
  * Add custom roles to the contactlist model for Groups and PresenceType.
  * Warnings--
  * NIE ontologies are now installed as standard, so don't ship our own copies.
  * Provide a ProxyModel allowing us to view contacts by group.
  * Fix checking if account contacts are buddies of is actually one of our own accounts.
  * ContactsListModel: Inherit from QAbstractItemModel instead of QAbstractListModel.
  * Start to introduce meta contacts, by creating Fake metacontacts for the all PersonContacts found.
  * Create a nice AbstractTreeItem class, which takes care of parent/child stuff, and use it for the base contactlist class.
  * Misc code tidyup.
  * Fix incorrect include.
  * Cascade properties better to metacontacts in the case of fake-meta-contacts.
  * Make the group-grouping proxy-model work with metacontacts.
  * Remove empty directory that is no longer needed.
  * Move the ontologies generation to the ontologies subdirectory. This is a hack until we remove generated classes from the public libktelepathy api.

  [ Matt Rogers ]
  * No margins please.

  [ Dario Freddi ]
  * Fixing buildsystem:  - Use shared desktop ontologies, as kdebase-runtime no longer ships ontologies  - Add ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share to telepathy.trig find path, which should make the whole system more solid
  * Adding support for avatars into the contactlist (MR #3408)
  * CCMAIL: grundleborg@googlemail.com
  *  * Add a real singleton guarded by K_GLOBAL_STATIC to NepomukSignalWatcher  * Delete correctly Soprano model

  * Add a description to the image opening dialog
  * Make contact-list aware of any incoming presence publication requests
  * Make sure the contact manager is ready before listing contacts
  * Don't rely on sender() exclusively, as we're calling onContactManagerStateChanged also from a standard method call
  * Expand only the item belonging to the account which is being connected - and collapse it upon disconnection
  * Cast properly: never use static_cast unless strictly required, and use qobject_cast wherever possible
  * Includes done right: own include must always go first, moc should go to the bottom - and remember a newline at the end of the file
  * Always use deleteLater() on QObject except some special cases, and beware: connect() can crash if the sender is null as well.
  * Add missing copyrights
  * AbstractWidgetDelegateOverlay: Make m_widget a QWeakPointer. Given that we strongly rely on having m_widget == 0 on deletion, just use the proper method.

  * Testing commit
  * Strip down all KTelepathy/Nepomuk dependencies for now. This contains a fake contacts set, fake model and a _very_ basic contact list with almost no features at all (grouping, sorting, filtering etc.). Also the avatar pixmaps have hardcoded paths for when running this from build/ folder. This will change later.
  * Very basic working contact list. Not much features yet, ugly and so on. But working ;)
  * Created an AccountButton, which serves as a button (QToolButton) with integrated pop-up menu to set account presence for one account, which this button represents. Can be simply reused elsewhere.
  * Switched the account QPushButtons to the new AccountButton, some code cleanup and painter polishing.
  * Remove unimplemented methods
  * Added animated QFrame to display some messages (info, errors etc) to user
  * Added delegate overlays, that shows action buttons for starting text/audio/video channel. So far only start text channel button is implemented. Code needs cleaning and making it easier to read/understand. Also licence text needs unifying etc. The main focus is now functionality, code polishing will come later ;)
  * Don't show the overlay for offline contacts
  * New model role returning contact capabilities. Also removing the "Info" and "Err" test buttons.
  * Show only those capabilities in the overlay, that are acutaly present.
  * Big changes. New contact list model based on TelepathyQt4Yell model. Removed unused code/files. Some code cleanup. More will follow.
  * Another code cleanup and unused files removal.
  * Unify licence text, remove Tpy namespace and fix some compile warnings.
  * Rename the executable to telepathy-kde-contactlist. Also filter out contacts with Unknown-type presence together with offline contacts.
  * Remove Nepomuk includes
  * Add status info to the AccountButton tooltip
  * Added new button which toggles showing/hiding offline users. Plus some minor changes here and there.
  * Make the account group header pretty again
  * Don't show account groups for accounts that are not online, but show them only if the account becomes online
  * Add an "Connecting" indicator to AccountButton
  * Delegate elide text patch by <xzekecomax at gmail dot com>
  * Remove the account group (contacts parent) as well with the contacts. This is only temporary until the offline contacts are implemented.
  * Disable the "Disconnected!" popup for now to keep the behaviour consistent.
  * Add expand/collapse sign to the groups headers
  * Add TP_DEBUG cmake option to enable Tp-Qt4 debug output
  * Add missing config.h.cmake file
  * Added dynamic accounts showing up/hiding when the account is enabled/created or disabled/removed. Also the big parts of commented-out code was removed.

  * Move the generated config.h to build/ to not confuse others
  * Fix crash when going offline.

  * Remove old files
  * Use toUInt() instead of toInt()
  * New method refilter(), which calls the protected invalidateFilter(). This method is for retriggering the filtering from outside.
  * Make sure the disconnected account group gets filtered out.
  * Loose the timer on overlays, fix some delegate hardcoded positions and move the overlay buttons to the left. Not sure if this will stay though.
  * Some drawing improvements
  * Custom presence message support plus switching to the KMainWindow (from QWidget). Also some additional cleanups and ui changes.
  * Fix a crash. More like a workaround really though..

  * Add contact context menu by Keith Rusler <comawhite>
  * Added tooltips to the contact list, so users can see information about the contact on mouse hover on that contact. Right now it supports the basics like status, account the contact is on, alias and personal message the contact uses.
  * Added default avatar to tooltips only if the contact has no default avatar else it will use the contacts avatar.
  * Search through all the available accounts to retrieve the contact groups that are available to us then we append them together so that the user can move contacts all to the same groups etc instead of what we current had that would only move them between groups that only that contact had for that protocol.
